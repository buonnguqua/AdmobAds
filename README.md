# Unity Admob Ads Demo

Test build ok with Unity 2022 LTS

> [!NOTE]
> If debug by AndroidLogcat (in Unity press Alt + F6), result `failed to load an ad with error: "Code": 3, "Message": "No fill"`. There is nothing wrong with your code, the issue is admob doesnt always have Ads to return for your request
